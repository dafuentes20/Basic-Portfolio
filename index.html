<h2>About Me</h2>
<img src="/Users/alanfountain/Desktop/Basic-Portfolio/assets/images/IMG_1168.JPG" width: "250px"; height="250px";/><p>My name is Alan Fountain. I am 26 years old! I was born and raised in Bountiful, Utah or Btown for us locals! 
        I love sports, movies, musicals, trying new foods and just having a good time! I am by far one of the biggest Utah Jazz fans that I know! </p>
    <br>
<p>I had the privelage of living in Peru for two years while I was serving an LDS mission. It was the best two years for my life! I was able to learn Spanish, to see a great culture and learn many things that will forever help me. <br>A little over a year ago I met the greatest lady in the world who can be seen in this picture.
I graduated from LDS Business College with an Associates in Business Management. I have worked in sales most of my life and currently work for a medical company in the Customer Service Department.</p>
